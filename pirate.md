IF YOU'VE STUMBLED ON THIS PAGE SO FAR, I'M STILL WORKING OUT A FILE HOSTING SOLUTION.  I'LL POST THE LINKS AND OFFICIALLY PUBLISH TH EPAGE WHEN EVERYTHING IS IRONED OUT.

tl:dr - Free books, ya'll!  Just, you know, buy them if you did like them and can afford them, or buy your favorite, or something.  Links [at the bottom]()

People say that information should be free or wants to be free.  I don't know about that.  Personification is a literary device, not a logical one, after all.

What I do know, or rather what I do think, is that all information, be it art or be it education, informs the reader and contributes to a larger social conversation (or in my case, mis-informs the reader...).  I don't like the idea of denying someone access to any sort of information , any sort of access to a conversation, because of how much money they may or may not have.  It just doesn't sit well with me.

On top of this, the people who pirate the most media tend to be the people who buy the most---in these cases, piracy only means a lost sale if they didn't like what they downloaded, which seems fair to me that people not buy something they didn't like.  In cases where people pirate media because they can't afford it, piracy isn't resulting in a lost sale, they couldn't afford to buy it in the first place, right?

I'm glad I'm not a grocer.  To be in a position where people are starving but you can't just give them food, because groceries are physical goods and you have to sell what you have in order to get more.  To give it all away would mean you're out of business.  Selling digital goods, I can give it all away and still have exactly as much as I started with.  So I am.

Every BABU Guide will be made available here, on this side, for free.  Please understand what this means for me however.

At the time of writing this, I'm working a full time job.  I'd like to write more, more guides and other things like novels, comics, etc.  That requires more time and more resources.  So please keep in mind, if you like what you read and feel it was worth the money, or you'd like to see what else I can do and want to help, step on over to Gumroad and
