**tl:dr** - *Free guides, everybody!  Just, you know, consider buying them if like them, or help spread the word if you don't have money to spare.  Links [at the bottom](#links).*\\

People say that information should be free or wants to be free.  I don't know about that.  Personification is a literary device and not a logical one after all, though I certainly understand the sentiment.

What I do know, or rather what I do think, is that all information, be it art, education, or raw data, informs the reader and contributes to a larger social conversation (or in my case, mis-informs the reader...).  I don't like the idea of denying someone access to any sort of information , any sort of access to a conversation, because of how much money they may or may not have.  It just doesn't sit well with me.

On top of this, the people who pirate the most media tend to be the people who buy the most---in these cases, piracy only means a lost sale if they didn't like what they downloaded, which seems fair to me that people not buy something they didn't like.  In cases where people pirate media because they can't afford it, piracy isn't resulting in a lost sale, they couldn't afford to buy it in the first place, right?

I'm glad I'm not a grocer.  To be in a position where people are starving but you can't just give them food, because groceries are physical goods and you have to sell what you have in order to get more.  To give it all away would mean you're out of business.  Selling digital goods, I can give it all away and still have exactly as much as I started with.  So I am.

Every BABU Guide will be made available here, on this site, for free.  If you download it here, and you find you don't like it, no worries.  Thanks for giving us a look.

If you did like it however, consider this:

At the time of writing this, I'm working a full time job.  Someday I'd like to leave this job, or at least step down to part time.  I'd like to write more, more guides and other things like novels, comics, etc.  That requires more time and more resources.  So, if you like these guides and feel they're worth money, or you'd like to see what else I can do and want to help, please [buy some](http://www.babuguides.com/guides/).

If you don't have money to spare, hey, I've been there.  You can still help support these works though, by spreading the word.  Tell your friends, blog it, tweet it, add us on whatever social network you prefer, you know the drill.

Oh, and one more thing before I finally let you scroll past to the links.  If anybody ever posts any of my works to a torrent site or something, I'd appreciate a link back to this page in the description, and perhaps drop me an [email](mailto:egghead@babuguides.com) so I can see what the response is.  No DMCA bullshit, no takedown notices, I promise.
