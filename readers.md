# Ebook Readers

Hello, as an avid reader myself I have a few suggestions and comments on ebook readers, comments that are now informed by being on the production side as well.

My ebook reader of choice on every platform used to be FBReader, which is mostly awesome and handles many different file types, but unfortunately it has two main issues:  It sometimes uses a font that doesn't display italics.  Why they don't just use a different font I don't know, but you can change it in the settings.  The other problem is that they don't support blockquote tags in epub documents, which is a pretty big deal depending on what you're reading, as it can make reading non-fiction (or even BABU guides) a bit confusing.  If FBReader would just add blockquote support I could go back to highly recommending it to everyone.  Please, developers?  I have submitted comments to them requesting it, but what are you going to do?

For your desktop OS (Windows, Mac, Linux), I suggest Calibre, which is a library management tool I don't use except for the ebook-convert and ebook-viewer modules, which are very powerful.  I have yet to see Calibre's ebook-viewer render an epub wrong in Windows or Linux, and I would live it if they would release an Android reader at some point (though I doubt that's likely).

On Android, I use EPUB Reader (the one by Michael Volz, there are a lot of apps by that name).  It's extremely lightweight and correctly renders everything  I've thrown at it, but it does only open epubs.

Also for Android, Aldiko is nice but it doesn't properly scale cover images in our epubs for come reason, and we can't figure out why. We'd shrink our cover images but it's the size required by certain large retailers.  Besides that scaling issue, it's a good reader with a free version.

Windows also has Sumatra, which is a great pdf and comic book reader that added epub and mobi support (probably among other things), but it doesn't quite render things like bullet points correctly.  In a pinch it gets the job done though.

Cool Reader, which is very cross-platform, has formatting issues as well, both with blockquotes and other issues that I don't recall right now because I didn't write them down at the time.  Sorry.

If you're using an iPhone you're on your own, but I will point out some red flags.  BABU guides use custom css (as do most epubs).  There should be no blank lines between normal paragraphs, and the beginning of every paragraph (except for the first) should be indented.  Any "BABU Fun Fact" or similar should be a mixture of bold and italics, and should be in a blockquote (the whole block of text indented).  It's possible we've misformatted one here or there but if none of them render like that then your epub reader isn't properly displaying all the formatting features of epub files.

Some readers ignore css and display paragraphs in blocks.  That's fine if you'd rather read it that way, I'm not saying ditch your reader to get a style you don't like as much, it's just something to be aware of.  Also, we try to wrap every blockquote in italics tags, so if you're using a reader that doesn't properly render blockquotes you should still be able to follow everything as long as italics are being displayed.

As always, email me with any questions or comments at [thatdude@babuguides.com]().  Also as always I'm way to disorganized to respond to everything, but any feedback still appreciated.
